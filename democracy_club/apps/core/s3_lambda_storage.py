class ReadOnlySourceFileSystemFinder(FileSystemFinder):
    """
    A Django storage class for finding static files on a read only file system
    or directory.

    ## Why is this needed?

    Finding files doesn't require write permissions, however 3rd party
    projects like Django Pipeline can implement a `post_process` step.

    This step takes the list of files returned by `list` and processes them,
    in pipeline's case by converting them from scss to css etc.

    The `post_process` step can change the file name, but if the file isn't
    written to a path that a finder can find then it's ignored in later steps.

    For example, ManifestFilesMixin won't know about that file.

    To make everything work this Finder runs exactly like the normal
    FileSystemFinder, but then copies the whole assets tree to a writable
    location. It then updates the paths for all the files to that new location,
    meaning all other processing of that file can happen as normal.

    Manuel Both-Hanz pulled his hair out to bring you this information.
